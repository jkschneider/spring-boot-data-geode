and client/server development environments.
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/issues/52

* Fixes the EnableSslCondition and nested Conditions to properly consider the SBDG property for enabling and disabling
SslAutoConfiguration.
* Fixes an issue caused by Apache Geode that makes Spring Boot think all Spring Boot, Apache Geode applications
are Web Applications.  This is dues to geode-core's compile-time dependency on 'org.eclipe.jetty:jetty-server', which
itself has a transitive dependency on the 'javax.servlet:javax.servlet-api'.  Therefore, SBDG Starters add an exclude
on the 'javax.servlet-api'.
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/issues/47
* Removes the runtime dependency on the 'javax.cache:cache-api' for the SBDG Starters, which is no longer
