[[about]]
== Spring Boot for {geode-name}

_Spring Boot for {geode-name}_ (SBDG) extends https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[_Spring Boot_] to also include
_auto-configuration_ and other _convention & configuration_ features to simplify the development of _Spring_ applications
using https://geode.apache.org/[{geode-name}].

This project builds on https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot] along with
https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-geode[_Spring Data for {geode-name}_] (SDG),
https://spring.io/projects/spring-session-data-geode[_Spring Session for {geode-name}_] (SSDG)
and https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-test-data-geode[_Spring Test for {geode-name}_] (STDG).

[[notice]]
== NOTICE

[[notice-2023-january]]
*2023-January-17*:

At the end of 2022, VMware https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/blog/spring-for-vmware-gemfire-is-now-available[announced]
the general availability of the Spring for VMware GemFire portfolio of projects.

While these Spring based projects for VMware GemFire are open source and a succession to the Spring for Apache Geode
projects, they are not a replacement. VMware GemFire forked from the Apache Geode project and is not open source.
Additionally, newer Apache Geode and VMware GemFire clients are not backwards compatible with older Apache Geode
and VMware GemFire servers. You can begin the transition by starting https://docs.vmware.com/en/Spring-Boot-for-VMware-GemFire/index.html[here].

Alternatively, the Spring portfolio provides first-class https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/io.html#io.caching.provider[integration]
with other comparable caching providers. Also, see https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/integration.html#cache-store-configuration[here]
and https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/integration.html#cache-plug[here].

Finally, keep in mind, the Spring for Apache Geode projects will still be maintained until OSS and commercial support
ends. Maintenance will only include CVE and critical fixes. No new features or major enhancements will be made.
The Spring Boot for Apache Geode support timelines can be viewed https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot#support[here].
Also see the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/wiki/Spring-Boot-for-Apache-Geode-and-VMware-Tanzu-GemFire-Version-Compatibility-Matrix[Version Compatibility Matrix]
for up-to-date dependency and version details.

[[project-features]]
=== Project Features

SBDG adds dedicated _Spring Boot_ **auto-configuration** and *actuator* support for https://geode.apache.org/[{geode-name}]
and integrates with other _Spring_ projects in addition to 3rd-party Java libraries.

Among other things, this project builds on https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[_Spring Boot_]
and https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-geode/[_Spring Data for {geode-name}_] (SDG) to offer:

1. _Auto-configures_ an _{geode-name}_ {geode-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/cache/client/ClientCache.html[ClientCache]
instance automatically when _Spring Data for {geode-name}_ (SDG) is on the application's CLASSPATH.

2. _Auto-configures_ _{geode-name}_ as a _caching provider_ in {spring-docs}integration.html#cache[_Spring's Cache Abstraction_]
when _Spring Data for {geode-name}_ (SDG) is on the application's CLASSPATH to solve caching uses cases.

3. _Auto-configures_ _Spring Data for {geode-name}_ (SDG) {sbdg-docs}#geode-repositories[Repositories]
when _Spring Data for {geode-name}_ (SDG) is on the application's CLASSPATH and _Spring Boot_ detects
SDG _Repositories_ in your _Spring Boot_ application to solve persistent use cases.

4. _Auto-configures_ _{geode-name}_ {sbdg-docs}#geode-functions[Functions] when _Spring Data for {geode-name}_ (SDG)
is on the application's CLASSPATH and _Spring Boot_ auto-detects SDG Function implementations or executions to solve
distributed compute problems.

5. _Auto-configures_ _{geode-name}_ {sbdg-docs}#geode-continuous-query[CQ] when _Spring Data for {geode-name}_ (SDG)
is on the application's CLASSPATH and _Spring Boot_ auto-detects SDG CQ query declarations on application components
to solve (near) realtime event stream processing use cases.

6. _Auto-configures_ {geode-name} as a {sbdg-docs}#geode-session[HTTP Session state management provider]
when _Spring Session for {geode-name}_ (SSDG) is on the application's CLASSPATH.

7. _Auto-configures_ _{geode-name}_ {sbdg-docs}#geode-security[Security]
including {sbdg-docs}#geode-security-auth[Authentication & Authorization (Auth)]
as well as {sbdg-docs}#geode-security-ssl[Transport Layer Security (TLS) using SSL].

8. Provides additional support for _Spring Boot_ and _Spring Data for {geode-name}_ applications deployed to
{sbdg-docs}#cloudfoundry[VMware Tanzu Application Service (TAS)] using {gemfire-name} for VMs.

9. Provides first-class support for Unit & Integration Testing in your _Spring Boot_ applications using {geode-name}
with _Spring Test for {geode-name}_ (STDG).

This, along with many other benefits, are provided by this project.

[[get-started]]
=== Get Started!

To start using SBDG immediately, simply add the following dependency to your _Spring Boot_ application Maven POM
or Gradle build file:

.SBDG Maven POM dependency
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.geode</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-geode-starter</artifactId>
    <version>{sbdg-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

.SBDG Gradle build dependency
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    compile "org.springframework.geode:spring-geode-starter:{sbdg-version}"
}
----

If you are using a SNAPSHOT or MILESTONE version of SBDG, perhaps to pick up a bug fix, improvement or new feature,
be sure to declare the appropriate Spring Repository.  For example, the when using a MILESTONE (e.g. M1), declare the
Spring Milestone Repository.

.Spring Milestone Repository declared in Maven POM
[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <name>spring-milestone</name>
        <url>https://repo.spring.io/milestone</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
----

.Spring Milestone Repository declare in `build.gradle`
[source,groovy]
----
repositories {
    maven { url "https://repo.spring.io/milestone" }
}
----

NOTE: To use a SNAPSHOT, simply change the URL from `https://repo.spring.io/milestone`
to `https://repo.spring.io/snapshot`.

NOTE: Spring SNAPSHOT and MILESTONE artifacts are not published to Maven Central. Only GA release bits are published to
Maven Central. When using GA bits, you do not need to declare a Repository for Maven Central when using Maven. You do
need to declare `mavenCentral()` when using Gradle.

[[get-started-spring-initializer]]
==== Getting Started with Spring Initializer

To make the task of creating a project even easier, the Spring Team recommends that you start at
https://start.spring.io[start.spring.io].

Use this https://start.spring.io/#!platformVersion={spring-boot-version}&dependencies=geode[link] to create
a _Spring Boot_ project using {geode-name}.

In addition to declaring the SBDG dependency, `org.springframework.geode:spring-geode-starter`, the Maven POM or Gradle
build file generated with _Spring Initializer_ at _start.spring.io_ includes the SBDG BOM, conveniently declared in a
dependency management block in both Maven and Gradle projects. This is convenient when you anticipate that you will need
to use more than 1 SBDG module.

For example, if you will also be using the `org.springframework.geode:spring-geode-starter-session` module for your
(HTTP) Session management needs, or perhaps the `org.springframework.geode:spring-geode-starter-test` module to write
Unit & Integration Tests for your _Spring Boot_, {geode-name} applications, then you can simply add the dependency
and let the BOM manage the version for you. This also makes it easier to switch versions without having to change
all the dependencies; simply change the version of the BOM.

[[get-started-application]]
==== Simple Spring Boot, {geode-name} application

In this section, we build a really simple _Spring Boot_ application using {geode-name} showing you how to
get started quickly, easily and reliably.

For our example, we will create and persist a `User` to {geode-name}, then lookup the `User` by name.

We start by defining our `User` application domain model class.

.User class
[source,java]
----
@Getter
@ToString
@EqualsAndHashCode
@RequiredArgsConstructor
@Region("Users")
class User {

	@lombok.NonNull @Id
	private final String name;

}
----

We use https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok] to simplify the implementation of our `User` class. Otherwise, the
only requirement to store `Users` in {geode-name} is to declare the `User` to data store mapping. We do this by
annotating the `User` class with the SDG `@Region` mapping annotation along with declaring the `User.name` property
to be the ID of `User` instances.

By declaring the `@Region` mapping annotation we are stating that instances of `User` will be stored in an {geode-name}
cache `Region` named "`Users`". The _Spring Data_ `@Id` annotation serves to declare the identifier for a `User` object
stored in {geode-name}. This is not unlike JPA's `@javax.persistence.Table` and `@javax.persistence.Id` mapping
annotations.

NOTE: An {geode-name} `Region` is equivalent to a database table and the cache is equivalent to a database schema.
A database schema is a namespace for a collection of tables whereas an {geode-name} cache is a namespace for a group of
`Regions` that hold the data. Each data store has its own data structure to organize and manage data. An RDBMS uses
a tabular data structure. Graph databases use a graph. Well, {geode-name} uses a `Region`, which is simply a key/value
data structure, or a map. In fact, an {geode-name} `Region` implements `java.util.Map` (indirectly) and is essentially
a distributed, horizontally scalable, highly concurrent, low-latency (among other things) `Map` implementation.

Next, let's define a _Spring Data_ `CrudRepository` to persist and access `Users` stored in {geode-name}.

.UserRepository
[source,java]
----
interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository<User, String> { }
----

Finally, let's create a _Spring Boot application_ to tie everything together.

.Spring Boot, {geode-name} application
[source,java]
----
@Slf4j
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableClusterAware
@EnableEntityDefinedRegions(basePackageClasses = User.class)
public class UserApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(UserApplication.class, args);
	}

	@Bean
	@SuppressWarnings("unused")
	ApplicationRunner runner(UserRepository userRepository) {

		return args -> {

			long count = userRepository.count();

			assertThat(count).isZero();

			log.info("Number of Users [{}]", count);

			User jonDoe = new User("jonDoe");

			log.info("Created User [{}]", jonDoe);

			userRepository.save(jonDoe);

			log.info("Saved User [{}]", jonDoe);

			count = userRepository.count();

			assertThat(count).isOne();

			log.info("Number of Users [{}]", count);

			User jonDoeFoundById = userRepository.findById(jonDoe.getName()).orElse(null);

			assertThat(jonDoeFoundById).isEqualTo(jonDoe);

			log.info("Found User by ID (name) [{}]", jonDoeFoundById);
		};
	}
}

@Getter
@ToString
@EqualsAndHashCode
@RequiredArgsConstructor
@Region("Users")
class User {

	@lombok.NonNull @Id
	private final String name;

}

interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository<User, String> { }
----

The `UserApplication` class is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` making it a proper _Spring Boot_ application.
With SBDG on the classpath, this effectively makes our application an {geode-name} application as well. SBDG will
_auto-configure_ an {geode-name} `ClientCache` instance by default when SBDG is on the application classpath.

With the SDG `@Region` mapping annotation, we declared that instances of `User` will be stored in the "`Users`" `Region`.
However, we have not yet created a "`Users`" `Region`. This is where the `@EnableEntityDefinedRegions` annotation comes
in handy. Like JPA/Hibernate's ability to create database tables from our `@Entity` declared classes, SDG's
`@EnableEntityDefinedRegions` annotation scans the classpath for application entity classes (e.g. `User`)
and detects any classes annotated with `@Region` in order to create the named `Region` required by the application
to persist data. The `basePackageClasses` attribute is a type-safe way to limit the scope of the scan.

While useful and convenient during development, `@EnableEntityDefinedRegions` was not made into an _auto-configuration_
feature by default since there are many ways to define and configure a `Region`, which varies from data type to data
type (e.g. transactional data vs. reference data), and varies greatly by use case and requirements.

We make use of 1 more powerful annotation, SBDG's `@EnableClusterAware`, which allows you to switch between local-only,
embedded development to a client/server topology with no code or configuration changes.

TIP: You can learn more about the `@EnableClusterAware` annotation in SBDG's reference documentation
(see {sbdg-docs}#geode-configuration-declarative-annotations-productivity-enableclusteraware[here]
and in the {sbdg-docs}guides/getting-started.html[_Getting Started_] Sample).

Our Java `main` method uses _Spring Boot's_ `SpringApplication` class to bootstrap the the {geode-name} `ClientCache`
application.

Finally, we declare an `ApplicationRunner` bean to persist a `User` and then lookup the stored `User` by ID (or "name").
Along the way, we log the operations to see the application in action.

.Example application log output (formatted to fit this screen)

That's it! That's all!

We have just created a simple _Spring Boot_ application using {geode-name} to persist and access data.

[[get-started-next]]
===== Where To Next

To continue your journey of learning, see the {sbdg-docs}[Reference Documentation] and jump into the <<examples>> below.

[[examples]]
=== Examples

The single, most relevant "_source of truth_" on how to get started quickly, easily and reliably, using Spring Boot
for {geode-name} (SBDG) to solve problems, is to start with the {sbdg-docs}#geode-samples[Samples]. There, you will
find different examples with documentation and code showing you how to use SBDG to effectively handle specific
application concerns, like Caching.

Additionally, there are examples that walk you through the evolution of SBDG to really showcase what SBDG affords you.
The examples start by building a simple Spring Boot application using {geode-name}'s API only. Then, the app is rebuilt
using Spring Data for {geode-name} (SDG) to show the simplifications that SDG brings to the table. Finally, the app is
rebuilt once more using SBDG to demonstrate the full power of {geode-name} when combined with _Spring Boot_. The examples
can be found in the https://github.com/kohlmu-pivotal/PCCDemo[PCCDemo] GitHub repository. Each app can be deployed to
Pivotal CloudFoundry (PCF) and bound to a Pivotal Cloud Cache (PCC) service instance. By using SBDG, little to no code
or configuration changes are required to run the app locally and then later deploy the same app to a managed environment
like PCF. It just works!

Then, there is the https://github.com/jxblum/temperature-service/tree/using-spring-boot[Temperature Service] example app
showcasing an  _Internet of Things_ (IoT) and _Event Stream Processing_ (ESP) Use Case to manage Temperature Sensors
and Monitors, powered by {geode-name} with the help of SBDG to make the application configuration and implementation
as simple as can be.
